These clients are compiled and you can use them to test how tftp works.
They come compiled for four different architectures found on the schhols unix and Linux systems.

tftp_xxx_linux - For use on the computer in the lab rooms or via the ThinLinc client
tftp_xxx_linuxserver - For use with the Linux servers (e.g., tussilago, vitsippa)
tftp_xxx_solaris_sparc - For use with the login unix servers (e.g., hamberg, pilspetsen) running
                         Solaris with a Sparc hardware architecture.
tftp_xxx_solaris_x86:64 - For use with the login unix servers (e.g., beurling, celcius) running
                          Solaris with a x86 64-bit hardware architecture.


For the latter two, you can find out your architecture type by typing the following in the terminal:

uname -a

then you will see something like this,

SunOS hamberg.it.uu.se 5.10 Generic_148888-04 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-80

indicating that you are running on SPARC for example.

You can also look at the information on the webpages:
http://www.it.uu.se/datordrift/maskinpark/


To run the program type

./tftp_6969_sparc -g medium.pdf rabbit.it.uu.se

The number 6969 or any other number indicates which port on the server that the client will be using.
